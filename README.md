### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shawn, a self-taught developer. I started out with Harvard's CS50 in 2019 and got hooked on programming ever since. I have mainly been exploring full stack web development and have also been dabbling in using SikuliX for scripting purposes at work. Welcome to my GitHub!

## Projects

### &#128138; Pocket Pharmacist -- [View Live](https://codingshawn.github.io/pocket-pharmacist/)
[Source Code](https://github.com/CodingShawn/pocket-pharmacist)

A mobile-responsive webpage that allows users to search for information on Singapore registered therapeutic products. 

Built using **React** and **Material-UI** frameworks. Search results were presented using the [MUI-Datatables](https://github.com/gregnb/mui-datatables) library. Information was pulled using API calls to 
Listing of Registered Therapeutic Products dataset provided under the Singapore Open Data Licence. 

### &#128674; Battleships App -- [View Live](https://codingshawn.github.io/TOP-JS-Battleship/)
[Source Code](https://github.com/CodingShawn/TOP-JS-Battleship)

A Battleship clone where users play against a computer player. 

App was built using **Vanilla Javascript** and **CSS3**. Experimented with Test Driven Development by writing tests first before writing actual functions.

### &#128270; Find Pokemon App
[Source Code](https://github.com/CodingShawn/TOP-JS-Finding-Pokemon)

A Finding Waldo clone where users have to locate certain Pokemon as fast as possible. Players are able to submit their scores to the hall of fame and the top 5 players' scores will be shown.
